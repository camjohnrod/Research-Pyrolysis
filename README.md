This is an experimental Python script which uses asymptotic expansion homogenization (AEH) to model the pyrolysis of SiC/SiC composite materials. This script generally follows the formulation of "Multiscale study of the process deformation for SiC/SiC composite
materials in PIP process" by Zhang et al. (2023).
